== README
Dave Faliskie created the following program, called Infection, for a project-based interview with Khan Academy.

Infection was created using Ruby on Rails and MySQL
Versions 
	Rails 4.1.8
	Ruby 2.1.2p95
	MySQL  Ver 14.14 
This can be run in a local environment that supports the above versions.

>> The main page will list all the users
>> All new users start on version 1.0 
>> Users can have their versions changed by clicking 'Change Version' and entering a new version
>> Users can add students by clicking 'Add Student'
	>> When a user adds a student, that user becomes the coach, this coach-student relationship works so that coaches have students 
	>> Users can have many coaches

>> If a user is a student to many coaches, whichever coach updated the most recently will give their version to that student
	>> Students of that user will be changes as well
>> If a user changes their version all students of that user will be changed
	>> Students of that user will be changes as well
>> The implementation of â€˜infectionâ€™ can be found in the users_controller update

>> Notes: 
		>> There are no permission restrictions meaning anyone can update anything.
		>> When a new student is added they will stay on their current version 
		>> There is no limited_infection implimented.
